# Course Content and Learning Outcomes

## Course Contents
- Internet's structure and different components.
- Layered network models: overview of the Internet model.
- Communication models: "Client-server" and "peer-to-peer".
- Internet-based applications and their protocols: DNS, SMTP, HTTP etc.
- Design and implementation of applications according to the client/server model. Socket programming.
- Principles of transport protocols and the services they offer. Internet-based transport protocols: TCP and UDP.
- Flow regulation, congestion control and error handling. Stop-and-wait, Go-Back-N as well as window handling and congestion control in TCP.
- Interconnected networks: Internet Protocol (IP), datagram services, packet switching, routing protocols and routing algorithms.
- Local area networks: topologies, access control, Ethernet, wireless local area networks, switched local area networks, link protocols. Network in data centers. Detection of transmission errors.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
After passing the course, the student should be able to:
- Describe and explain basic terms and concepts used in networking and communication
- Analyse communication scenarios and application requirements and explain which methods and algorithms are appropriate to offer a desired communication service
- Explain, model and analyse the behaviour of networks using different methods for error handling and flow control
- Explain different methods for congestion control and how they react to different events and conditions in the network
- Explain the functions of protocols of the different layers of the Internet model and how different layers interact with one another
- Explain and compare basic algorithms and mechanisms for path selection and how they react to different events and conditions in the network
- Use socket programming to implement simple applications according to the client/server model
- Design, implement and analyse the behaviour of simple Internet-based applications and their protocols
- Design and configure simpler networks with basic services such as DHCP and DNS
- Explain different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks
- Calculate or estimate performance in terms of delay, throughput and utilization in interconnected networks

In order to:
- Understand and utilise computer communication and computer networks in a reliable and efficient way in systems and applications
- Lay the foundation for continued studies in the area
